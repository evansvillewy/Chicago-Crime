                  Machine Learning:We examined the ability of three machine learning algorithms to predict whether 
                  recorded crimes in the City of Chicago resulted in an arrest. This is a classification problem 
                  with a binary answer â€“ arrest or no arrest. We used the official City of Chicago data portal 
                  at https://data.cityofchicago.org/ to download crime records for the years 2016-2019. We 
                  decided to train our model on information from the years 2016-2018. This provided us with a 
                  robust dataset of 787 901 observations. The dataset had 22 features, which were a mix of time, 
                  location, and other categorical data. We tested the ability of our models to predict arrests 
                  for the 256 908 crimes recorded in 2019. The three models used were a Random Forest (RF) 
                  classifier, a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classification model, and a linear Support 
                  Vector Machine (SVM) model. Feature engineering was done differently in each of the three
                  models, and the features included to predict the target were different. The RF classifier
                   used the following 12 features: month, hour, day of week, district, block, ward, beat, 
                   community area, location description, FBI code, primary type, anddomestic. The SGD model
                    used the following 11 features one hot encoded resulting in a total of 100 columns: 
                    month, hour, day of week, district, ward, community area, description, location 
                    description, fbi code, primary type, and domestic. The SVM model used the following 13 
                    features: month, hour, day of week, district, ward, beat, community area, description, 
                    location description, iucr, FBI code, primary type, and domestic.Of the models tested 
                    herein, the RF classifier performed best with a weighted average f1-score of 0.85, SGD 
                    second best with 0.83 and the SVM model last with 0.69. All three models were much better 
                    at labeling crimes that did not result in arrest as non-arrest than those that did result 
                    in arrest as arrest. Specifically, all three models classified less than 50% of true arrests 
                    as arrests but classified virtually 100% of true non-arrests as non-arrests. Conversely, all 
                    three models had weighted average precision greater than 75%, meaning that for all instances 
                    classified one way or the other, based on the numerical occurrence of each class, they were 
                    correct 75% of the time.

                  We believe this exercise was a useful examination of the conditions that could help predict the 
                  quantity and likelihood of solving crimes given a particular set of characteristics. As reported 
                  by the Pew Research Center, 
                  (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/01/most-violent-and-property-crimes-in-the-u-s-go-unsolved/) most 
                  violent and property crimes in the US go unsolved. Efforts to establish criminal patterns could 
                  bolster the efforts of law enforcement in solving crimes and preventing future ones. While our models 
                  did notprovide clear evidence for particular conclusions, the importance of feature engineering cannot 
                  be underestimated, and the different strengths of each model underscore the need for more work to be 
                  done in determining the best combination of features and machine learning algorithms for the task of 
                  establishing criminal patterns and arrests.
